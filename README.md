Hello, Developers!

Sufragia is and will be open source, forever. 

## Problems
Discussing with the team initial thoughts about social opportunities, we agreed that we shared many frustrations related to our role as citizens, basically the voting and citizen participation involvement. Timing, logistic arrangements for government and other entities, training other citizens, and last but not least all paper and risk confronting the data unconsistency, were the facts that made us realize the need for a tool providing society and any citizen as the final user, and alternative to express public opinion. There is where Sufragia started. 

## Solution
Sufragia is an intelligent and open platform promoting accesible citizen participation where every user from any community, state or even nation can broadcast a unique vote in a referendum, election or opinion. 

## Stack
Ruby on Rails, Faye library for real-time interaction, TextMagic over Twilio for SMS messaging, API Interface, Docker as container and Microsoft Azure for deployment. 

## Roadmap
  1. Citizen Assistant.  
  2. Flow diagram for campaigns and broadcast. 
  3. External datasets to feed platform and Assistant. 
  4. Native mobile apps both for Android and iOS. 
  5. Democracy adoption made easy with a deploy button.
